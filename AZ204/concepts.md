# Concepts

## Azure App Service
 - Scale up/down -> increase or decrease resources of the instances (ram, cpu...)
 - Scale in/out -> increase or decrease the number of the instances
 - Built in authentication: integrate identity providers (Microsoft, Facebook, Google or Twitter) to sign-in, manage token and handle unauthorized requests
 - 

 ### Pricing Tiers
  - Shared Compute (Free and Shared): shared resources and can't scale out -> use only for development or testing
  - Dedicated compute (Basic, Standard, Premium(s)): runs on dedicated VMs, higher tier more VM to scale out
  - Isolated: runs on dedicated VMs on dedicated Virtual Network, maxim scale out capabilities
  - Consumption: only for function apps, scales depending on workload
